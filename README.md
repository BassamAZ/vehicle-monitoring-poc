## Scenario:

    Imagine you are one of our consultants and you got assigned to a project at one of our top partners.
    They have a number of connected vehicles that belongs to a number of customers.
    They have a need to be able to view the status of the connection among these vehicles on a monitoring display.
    The vehicles send the status of the connection one time per minute.
    The status can be compared with a ping (network trace); no request from the vehicle means no connection.
    So, vehicle is either Connected or Disconnected.
