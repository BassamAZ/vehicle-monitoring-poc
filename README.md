    - They have a need to be able to view the status of the connection among these vehicles on a monitoring display.
    - The vehicles send the status of the connection one time per minute.
    - The status can be compared with a ping (network trace); no request from the vehicle means no connection.
    - So, vehicle is either Connected or Disconnected.
